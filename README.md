# Abstract

Estimation of the prevalence and contagiousness of undocumented novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections is critical for understanding the overall prevalence and pandemic potential of this disease. Here we use observations of reported infection within China, in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with COVID-19, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. We estimate 87% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [80%-92%]) prior to January 23, 2020 travel restrictions. Per person, these undocumented infections were 54% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-64%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging.
